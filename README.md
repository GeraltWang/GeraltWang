# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate front-end developer with a unique background. Although I didn't major in computer science, I discovered my love for web development during my university years through elective courses in modern web development and introductory Photoshop. This sparked my interest in front-end development, and I decided to pursue it further.

After completing my graduation thesis, I dedicated a year to learning front-end development intensively. This journey paid off, and I successfully transitioned into the industry.

Now, with three years of professional experience under my belt, I continue to hone my skills and contribute to exciting projects. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my craft.
